# What is it

This is a simple Mandelbrot zoom program with very simple controls, just use the mousewheel to zoom and click/drag to pan. Optimizations include the [pertubation method by K.I. Martin](http://www.science.eclipse.co.uk/sft_maths.pdf) as well as [Zhuoran's Glitch Fix](https://fractalforums.org/index.php?topic=4360.0). It uses egui for graphics.
